1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```

## Usage

To use the React TypeScript Table component in your React application, import it into your desired file and render it with the necessary props. Here's an example:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Table from './Table';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const data = [
    { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 25 },
    { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', age: 30 },
    // Add more data objects as needed
  ];

  const columns = [
    { header: 'ID', accessor: 'id' },
    { header: 'Name', accessor: 'name' },
    { header: 'Age', accessor: 'age' },
    // Add more columns as needed
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React TypeScript Table Example</h1>
      <Table data={data} columns={columns} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Make sure to replace `./Table` with the correct path to the `Table` component in your project.

## Props

The `Table` component accepts the following props:

- `data` (required): An array of objects representing the data to be displayed in the table.
- `columns` (required): An array of objects specifying the table columns, including their headers and accessors.
- `pageSize` (optional): The number of rows to display per page. Defaults to 10.
- `sortable` (optional): A boolean indicating whether the columns should be sortable. Defaults to `true`.
- `filterable` (optional): A boolean indicating whether the table should provide filtering functionality. Defaults to `true`.

## Customization

You can customize the styling of the table by modifying the CSS classes defined in the `Table` component's stylesheet (`Table.css`). Adjust the styles according to your application's design requirements.
